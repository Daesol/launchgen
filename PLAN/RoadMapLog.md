# Road Map Log

## 2025-01-20 - Lead Capture RLS Policy Fix

### What was done:
- **Fixed RLS policy violation for leads table** - Resolved "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'leads'" error when submitting lead forms
- **Updated capture-lead API to use service role** - Changed from authenticated client to service role client to bypass RLS for public lead capture
- **Created RLS policies for leads table** - Added proper RLS policies to allow public lead insertion while maintaining security for data access
- **Enhanced lead capture security** - Implemented policies that allow anyone to insert leads but restrict viewing/updating to page owners only

### Technical details:
- **Root cause**: The capture-lead API was using `createRouteHandlerClient` which requires authentication, but lead capture needs to work for anonymous public visitors
- **Service role solution**: Updated API to use `createClient` with `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to bypass RLS for lead insertion
- **RLS policy implementation**: Created comprehensive policies for leads table:
  - "Anyone can insert leads" - Allows public lead capture
  - "Users can view leads for their own pages" - Restricts lead viewing to page owners
  - "Users can update/delete leads for their own pages" - Restricts modifications to page owners
- **Security maintained**: Page owners can only see leads for their own pages, while public users can submit leads

### Files affected:
- `app/api/capture-lead/route.ts` - Updated to use service role client for public lead capture
- `supabase/migrations/20250120000004_fix_leads_rls.sql` - New migration with RLS policies for leads table
- `fix_leads_rls_manual.sql` - Manual SQL script for applying RLS policies

## 2025-01-20 - Dashboard Infinite Loading Bug Fix

### What was done:
- **Fixed infinite loading animation** - Resolved issue where dashboard showed infinite "Loading dashboard" animation when navigating back from /generate page
- **Eliminated data fetching conflicts** - Fixed conflict between DashboardSessionGate and useDashboardData hook both trying to manage dashboard data

- **Improved error handling** - Added proper error state handling in DashboardSessionGate with retry functionality
- **Enhanced loading state management** - Combined authentication loading and data loading states for better user experience

### Technical details:
- **Root cause**: DashboardSessionGate and useDashboardData were both fetching data independently, causing conflicts and infinite loading states
- **Event listener fix**: useDashboardData refetch function was being recreated on every render, causing useLayoutEffects to constantly re-register refresh-pages event listener
- **Data fetching consolidation**: DashboardSessionGate now only handles authentication, while useDashboardData handles all data fetching
- **useCallback optimization**: Wrapped fetchDashboardData in useCallback with proper dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **State management**: Combined loading states from both authentication and data fetching for unified loading experience
- **Error recovery**: Added error state with retry button for better user experience when data fetching fails

### Files affected:

## 2024-12-19 - Preview Mode Navigation Containment Fix

### What was done:
- **Fixed navigation bar containment in preview mode** - Navigation bar now stays within the landing page template when viewed in the editor preview
- **Made header positioning conditional** - Header uses relative positioning in preview mode, fixed positioning in standalone mode
- **Updated content padding logic** - Content padding is removed when in preview mode to prevent double spacing
- **Fixed scroll behavior in preview mode** - Scroll functions no longer apply header offset when header is relative positioned
- **Maintained standalone functionality** - Fixed positioning and proper scroll behavior still work when landing page is viewed standalone

### Technical details:
- **Conditional positioning**: Header uses `onSectionSelect` prop to detect preview mode and apply appropriate positioning
- **Preview mode detection**: When `onSectionSelect` is present, header uses relative positioning; when absent, uses fixed positioning
- **Content padding adjustment**: Main content padding is set to 0px in preview mode, normal padding in standalone mode
- **Scroll offset calculation**: All scroll functions check for preview mode and only apply header offset when header is fixed
- **Consistent behavior**: Both desktop and mobile navigation maintain proper scroll behavior in both modes

### Files affected:
- `components/PageEditorRefactored.tsx` - Pass previewMode prop to LandingPageTemplate
- `components/LandingPageTemplate.tsx` - Implement conditional header positioning and scroll behavior based on preview mode

## 2024-12-19 - Preview Mode Navigation Scroll Fix

### What was done:
- **Fixed navigation scroll functionality in preview mode** - Navigation links now properly scroll to sections when clicked in the editor preview

- **Maintained standalone scroll behavior** - Window scrolling still works correctly when landing page is viewed standalone
- **Updated all scroll functions** - Both desktop and mobile navigation now use appropriate scroll methods based on context

### Technical details:
- **Preview mode scrolling**: Uses `element.scrollIntoView()` to scroll within the preview container
- **Standalone mode scrolling**: Uses `window.scrollTo()` with proper header offset calculation
- **Context detection**: Uses `onSectionSelect` prop presence to determine which scroll method to use
- **Consistent behavior**: All scroll functions (scrollToCTA, scrollToSection, navigation links) use the same logic
- **Mobile navigation**: Mobile menu links also use the same conditional scroll behavior

### Files affected:
- `components/LandingPageTemplate.tsx` - Updated all scroll functions to work correctly in both preview and standalone modes
