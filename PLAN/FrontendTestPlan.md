## ðŸ”„ How to Use This Document
- Check off items as they are tested
- Log test results in the tables above
- Update as new features or endpoints are added

---

## Dashboard Authentication & Session Management
- [x] User is redirected to /auth/signin if not logged in (client-side check).
- [x] After login (including Google OAuth), user is correctly routed to /dashboard.
- [x] No redirect loop after login or OAuth.
- [x] Dashboard data loads only after session is confirmed.
- [x] All dashboard features work as expected after refactor.
